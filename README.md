Anime Nexus: Intelligent Anime Recommendation SystemProject OverviewAnime Nexus is a modern web application built with Python Flask that provides personalized anime recommendations. It intelligently suggests new anime titles by analyzing genres of a user's favorite anime and leveraging the Jikan API (an unofficial MyAnimeList API) for comprehensive data retrieval. The application features a sleek, responsive user interface designed with Tailwind CSS, enhancing user experience and showcasing full-stack development capabilities.FeaturesModern Web UI: Intuitive and visually appealing interface built with Flask and styled using Tailwind CSS for a responsive design.Intelligent Genre Matching: Fetches and maps official anime genre IDs from the Jikan API for highly accurate genre-based recommendations.Advanced Recommendation Logic: Recommends anime by calculating genre overlap with the user's favorite title, prioritizing titles with more shared genres and higher scores.Robust API Integration: Seamlessly interacts with the Jikan API to retrieve real-time anime details (title, synopsis, score, genres).Error Handling & Rate Limiting: Implements robust error handling for API requests and incorporates delays to respect API rate limits.Dynamic Content Display: Displays detailed information about the user's chosen anime and a curated list of recommendations.Technologies UsedBackend:Python 3.xFlask (Web Framework)requests library (HTTP requests to API)json library (JSON data handling)Frontend:HTML5Tailwind CSS (for modern, responsive styling)Jinja2 (Templating Engine for Flask)API:Jikan API (Unofficial MyAnimeList API: https://jikan.moe/)How to Run LocallyFollow these steps to set up and run the Anime Nexus application on your local machine:Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/anime-nexus.git
cd anime-nexus
(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username and anime-nexus with your repository name)Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:Install all required Python packages using pip. First, ensure you have a requirements.txt file (see "Preparation Step" in previous responses if you don't).pip install -r requirements.txt
(If you haven't created requirements.txt yet, run pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing Flask, requests, and gunicorn locally.)Run the Flask Application:python app.py
Access the Application:Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in your terminal (usually http://127.0.0.1:5000/).DeploymentThis application can be deployed on various platforms. Recommended free-tier options include:PythonAnywhere: Excellent for beginners, offering a straightforward setup for Flask applications.Render: Provides modern CI/CD integration with GitHub, automatically deploying changes.Google Cloud Run: A serverless option for scalable and cost-efficient deployment (requires Dockerization).Refer to the documentation of your chosen platform for specific deployment instructions.Future Enhancements (Ideas for Expansion)User Authentication: Implement user login/registration to save favorite anime and personalized recommendation history.More Advanced Recommendation Models: Explore machine learning techniques (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering with embeddings) for more sophisticated recommendations.Dynamic Content Loading: Implement AJAX/JavaScript to load recommendations without full page reloads.Search Autocomplete: Add an autocomplete feature to the input field for anime titles.User Ratings/Feedback: Allow users to rate recommendations to improve the system over time.Dockerization: Package the application in a Docker container for consistent environments and easier deployment to container-friendly platforms.LicenseThis project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
